Hello and Welcome. 

I am fascinated by the potential power of automation in respect to automating the management of systems, and enjoy learning and working with PowerShell. PowerShell is my favourite automation tool for daily work. Furthermore, I intend to branch out and learn cloud based Automation tools and technologies.

Feel free to view my repository where I have included various scripts which can be useful to you in your daily work as an Office 365 Administrator.
